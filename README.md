# portfolio2

a redesign of my personal site.


for development:
clone,
download,
from root folder: npm install
then: nodemon
then in chrome/safari/IE/whatever goto http://localhost:3000/

Angular and Angular router should be pulled in from CDN.

Gulp is installed and I have just started writing scss for this project. So after all the above, run gulp in the root folder and the scss should be compiled into css.
