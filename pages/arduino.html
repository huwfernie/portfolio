    <h2>Arduino</h2>
    <p>I was halfway across the Atlantic in a sailing boat, when we had a chat about digital barometers, it turns out that nothing on the market was a good fit for this boat. Too expensive, too big, too small, not enough featuresâ€¦ there was no perfect fit. Ultimately we never changed ours, but that laid the foundation of this project; build a digital barometer.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>The basic design brief came from the boat.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Small</li>
      <li>Cheap</li>
      <li>Low power</li>
      <li>Backlit</li>
      <li>history</li>
      <li>Graph?</li>
    </ul>

    <h2></h2>
    <p>It also had to be relatively quick and easy to make, so I settled on a design based around an Arduino microcontroller, a display from an old Nokia phone, and a small barometer module. Later I added a timer module to help with the history/graph feature.</p>

    <h2>Libraries</h2>
    <p>All the different parts have been used by hobbyists before, so there were already some libraries available which helped making the software quick and easy.</p>

    <h2>Circuit layout</h2>
    <p>Putting it all together at first was on breadboard with wires and a few resistors to connect it all, then I transfered that onto a prototype shield, which fits inside a small waterproof case.</p>
