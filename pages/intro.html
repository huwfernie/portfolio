    <p>I’m a web developer. At the moment I’m working on front end development for an agency in London. I am looking for new opportunities to grow in front end development or move into full stack development.</p>
    <p>Taking a look around this website you’ll find some JavaScript games, some full stack MVP’s and some other bits and pieces that I’ve been working on recently; a Node project for turning blogs into e&#8209;books and an Arduino powered digital barometer.</p>
    <p>I hope you find a few minutes to have a good poke around and if you like the look of any of the projects, or feel that I would be a good fit for your team then drop me an email.</p>
    <p>Cheers,</p>
    <p>Huw</p>
