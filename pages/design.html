    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>This build is a redesign of a site that I built about a year ago now, so that gave me a good reference point of what to aim for in the design. I wanted to include a little more information in this verison, having worked on new projects and had time to dust off some old ones too.</p>

    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>To tie down the scope I sketched out a paper plan of the nav menu, and played with different options and includes, it's always good to have this to come back to when it's been tempting to creep a little bit more in there.</p>

    <h3>Planning</h3>
    <p>The first draught of the HTML and CSS pulled the basic structure from the sketches and let me play around with some layout, sticking the footer with flex meant I didn't need a container in the HTML.</p>

    <h3>The Nav bar</h3>
    <p>Getting a bit carried away, I decided to have a fixed nav bar, and for certain sections another sub-nav bar. So I built a jQuery function that would populate the second nav bar, using a JSON style array of objects, each with children and addresses themselves.</p>

    <h3>Putting in Angular</h3>
    <p>It was getting to the point where a lot of content needed putting in. I had originally planned to hard code all the pages, however as this loomed, I decided that so much of the code was reuable, maybe I should just write a function to inject content into a template page... and soon I was reinventing Angular. I haven't done an angular app in a while, so it would be nice to play with this again.</p>

    <h3>Out comes the nav bar</h3>
    <p>That great function that I wrote to make my two layer nav bar; suddenly that wasn't needed. I could now include the second layer of nav at the top of my angular include. I could have anticipated this move a bit earlier, but it was still good practice.</p>
