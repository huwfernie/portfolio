    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>This build is a redesign of a site that I built about a year ago now, so that gave me a good reference point of what to aim for in the design. I wanted to include a little more information in this verison, having worked on new projects and had time to dust off some old ones too.</p>

    <figure class="design-sketch left"></figure>
    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <p>To tie down the scope I sketched out a paper plan of the nav menu, and played with different options and includes, it's always good to have this to come back to when it's been tempting to creep a little bit more in there.</p>
  </section>

    <figure class="design-rough-html right"></figure>
    <h2>Planning</h2>
    <p>The first draught of the HTML and CSS pulled the basic structure from the sketches and let me play around with some layout, sticking the footer with flex meant I didn't need a container in the HTML.</p>

    <figure class="design-navbar right"></figure>
    <h2>The Nav bar</h2>
    <p>Getting a bit carried away, I decided to have a fixed nav bar, and for certain sections another sub-nav bar. So I built a jQuery function that would populate the second nav bar, using a JSON style array of objects, each with children and addresses themselves.</p>

    <figure class="design-angular right"></figure>
    <h2>Putting in Angular</h2>
    <p>It was getting to the point where a lot of content needed putting in. I had originally planned to hard code all the pages, however as this loomed, I decided that so much of the code was reuable, maybe I should just write a function to inject content into a template page... and soon I was reinventing the wheel. I haven't done an angular app in a while, so it would be nice to play with this again.</p>

    <figure class="design-angular-navbar right"></figure>
    <h2>Out comes the nav bar</h2>
    <p>That great function that I wrote to make my two layer nav bar; suddenly that wasn't needed. I could now include the second layer of nav at the top of my angular include. I could have anticipated this move a bit earlier, to find a silver lining; it was still good practice.</p>

    <figure class="design-content right"></figure>
    <h2>Insert content</h2>
    <p>With the basic template of the page setup, now was a lot of typing and making notes on the various projects. In theory there will be more images to come, so part of the design will be to set up for these without having them yet.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <figure class="design-content right"></figure>
    <h2>Design style</h2>
    <p>Once there was a lot of content I needed to get the nav and sub-nav working properly, so I made an angular function to take care of that. It would be nice to include a highlight for the page you are currently on. But that's low down on the list of priorities for now.</p>

    <h2>Images</h2>
    <p>And then to round off all the text it's time to visit all the different projects and get some new screenshots…</p>
