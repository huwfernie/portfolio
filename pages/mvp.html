    <h2>Full Stack prototypes</h2>
    <p>I have here a few projects from my training course at General Assembly, as well as some other projects that I have worked on over the last year.</p>
    <p>Each one uses a slightly different stack, but they have similar themes throughout; user authentication, database integration, AWS storage, cloud deployed and more.</p>

    <h2>Node projects</h2>
    <p>I also have here two projets that I have worked on recently. Both are primarily Node.js and are more like tools than MVP's. Even though they have very specific use cases; buliding them both was a challenge, and gave me some nice problems to solve.</p>

      <h2>Yabee</h2>
      <p>Yabee; is Ebay spelled bakwards and with an extra 'e' added to help with pronouciation. It's the last project I did during my training at General Assembly and went from conception to this MVP in just over a week. The idea was to create a version of Ebay and Gumtree where it was also possible to list yourself, as a person willing to buy something. This would give sellers the option of a much quicker sale than waiting for an auction to end or for someone to respond to an add.</p>

      <h2>The Stack</h2>
      <p>The styling was taken from Gumtree.com, and at the time it was made many layout features would match to the pixel. The front end is Angular, while the back end is Ruby on rails talking to an SQL database.</p>
      <p>I wanted potential sellers to be able to talk with potential buyers, so I also made a simple message service within the app which works well but took a disproportionate amount of time to impliment.</p>
