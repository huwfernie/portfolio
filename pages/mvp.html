    <h2>Full Stack Prototypes</h2>
    <p>I have here a few projects from my training course at General Assembly, as well as some other projects that I have worked on over the last year.</p>
    <p>Each one uses a slightly different stack, but they have similar themes throughout; user authentication, database integration, AWS storage, cloud deployed and more.</p>

    <h2>Node projects</h2>
    <p>I also have here two projets that I have worked on recently. Both are primarily Node.js and are more like tools than MVP's. Even though they have very specific use cases; buliding them both was a challenge, and gave me some nice problems to solve.</p>

      <h2>Yabee</h2>
      <p>Yabee; is Ebay spelled bakwards and with an extra 'e' added to help with pronouciation. It's the last project I did during my training at General Assembly and went from conception to this MVP in just over a week. The idea was to create a version of Ebay and Gumtree where it was also possible to list yourself, as a person willing to buy something. This would give sellers the option of a much quicker sale than waiting for an auction to end or for someone to respond to an add.</p>

      <h2>The Stack</h2>
      <p>The styling was taken from Gumtree.com, and at the time it was made many layout features would match to the pixel. The front end is Angular, while the back end is Ruby on rails talking to an SQL database.</p>
      <p>I wanted potential sellers to be able to talk with potential buyers, so I also made a simple message service within the app which works well but took a disproportionate amount of time to impliment.</p>

      <h2>Travel Blogging</h2>
      <p>The idea for this site was to try to take some of the pain out of setting up and maintaining a personal blog, as well as being a single point to visit when looking for a bit of inspiration. So a cross between sites like <a href="http://www.instructables.com/"></a> and <a href="https://medium.com/"></a></p>

      <h2>The Stack</h2>
      <p>This site is built on a Node backend, using Express for the framework and EJS as the view engine. Blogs and users are saved in a NoSQL database.</p>

      <h2>Features</h2>
      <p>To help with presentation the site incorporates a google map with pins for each of the blogs. It also has facebook/twitter style profile pages. Blogs are written in markdown which lets the authors add some basic formatting and images can be added to blogs - these are stored on AWS.</p>

      <h2>City Running</h2>
      <p>Run-IMG was a group project, 4 peoples work from a week long sprint. The idea was to map out running routes in London. The start and end point for each route would be a recognisable monument or landmark. To register a run you need to submit a picture at the start and finish of the track which we use to verify and time the run.</p>

      <h2>The Stack</h2>
      <p>This is a MEAN stack app, as it was designed to be used on the go, all the styling was for mobile first. The end result was a great app that pulled in google maps for displaying the route, as well as </p>
